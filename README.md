[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/remind2)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remind2)  [![R build status](https://github.com/pik-piam/remind2/workflows/check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pik-piam/remind2/actions) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pik-piam/remind2/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/pik-piam/remind2) [![r-universe](https://pik-piam.r-universe.dev/badges/remind2)](https://pik-piam.r-universe.dev/builds)

## Purpose and Functionality

Contains the REMIND-specific routines for data and model
    output manipulation.


## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```
The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("remind2")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```

## Tutorial

The package comes with vignettes describing the basic functionality of the package and how to use it. You can load them with the following command (the package needs to be installed):

```r
vignette("compareScenariosRemind2") # compareScenarios in remind2
vignette("remind_summary")          # Adding plots to the REMIND_summary.pdf
vignette("remind2_reporting")       # remind2 reporting
```
